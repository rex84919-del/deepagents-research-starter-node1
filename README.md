# Deep Research Agent

> A multi-agent research assistant built with Deep Agents on EdgeOne Makers — a lead researcher delegates sub-questions to expert subagents with web search, then synthesizes a comprehensive answer.

**Framework:** Deep Agents · **Category:** Quick Start · **Language:** TypeScript

[![Deploy to EdgeOne Makers](https://cdnstatic.tencentcs.com/edgeone/pages/deploy.svg)](https://edgeone.ai/makers/new?template=deepagents-research-starter-node&from=within&fromAgent=1&agentLang=typescript)

## Overview

Deep Research Agent turns a single question into a multi-step research process. A lead researcher plans the approach, dispatches expert subagents to search the web in parallel, and synthesizes their findings into a final answer — all streamed to the frontend in real time.

- **Multi-agent research** — a coordinator delegates 2-3 sub-questions to expert researcher subagents running in parallel
- **Web search** — each subagent performs multiple web searches to gather information from multiple angles
- **Real-time streaming** — SSE delivers planning text, subagent progress, tool calls, and the final synthesis token-by-token
- **Conversation history** — previous research sessions are persisted via LangGraph checkpointer and restorable from the home history list
- **Stop generation** — abort a running research at any time; pending subagents are cancelled gracefully

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` | Yes | Model gateway API key. Use your **Makers Models API Key**, or any OpenAI-compatible provider key. |
| `AI_GATEWAY_BASE_URL` | Yes | Gateway base URL. For Makers Models, use `https://ai-gateway.edgeone.link/v1`. |
| `AI_GATEWAY_MODEL` | No | Model ID. Defaults to `@makers/deepseek-v4-flash` (a free built-in model). |
| `WSA_API_KEY` | No | Tencent Cloud Web Search API (WSA) key for the platform's built-in search tool. |

> This template follows the **OpenAI-compatible** standard — you can point these variables at Makers Models or any other compatible gateway / provider.

### How to get `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`

1. Open the [Makers Console](https://edgeone.ai/makers/new?s_url=https://console.tencentcloud.com/edgeone/makers).
2. Sign in and enable Makers.
3. Go to **Makers → Models → API Key** and create a key.
4. Copy it into `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` (set `AI_GATEWAY_BASE_URL` to `https://ai-gateway.edgeone.link/v1`).

Built-in models (`@makers/deepseek-v4-flash`, `@makers/hy3-preview`, `@makers/minimax-m2.7`) are free and rate-limited — great for prototyping. For production, bind your own provider key (BYOK) in the console.

### How to get `WSA_API_KEY`

The platform provides a built-in search tool powered by Tencent Cloud Web Search API (WSA). To use it:

1. Enable the **Web Search (WSA)** service in the [Tencent Cloud WSA Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/wsapi/index).
2. Obtain your API Key and set it as `WSA_API_KEY`.
3. See the [WSA API Documentation](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1806/130615) for details.

> If you prefer not to use Tencent Cloud WSA, you can integrate a third-party search service (e.g. [Exa](https://exa.ai/docs/reference/search-api-guide-for-coding-agents), [Tavily](https://docs.tavily.com/agents)) by replacing the `web_search` tool implementation.

## Local Development

**Prerequisites:** Node.js, npm

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
edgeone makers dev
```

Open `http://localhost:8080/agent-metrics` for the local observability panel.

## How It Works

The agent runs as a **session-mode** runtime: requests sharing the same `conversation_id` are routed to the same instance with persistent state.

### Workflow

1. **User asks a question** — the frontend sends a POST to `/stream` with `makers-conversation-id` header.
2. **Planning** — the lead researcher outputs a brief research plan (1-2 sentences) and dispatches 2-3 sub-questions in parallel via the `task` tool.
3. **Researching** — each expert subagent performs multiple web searches, gathers data, and writes a summary. Progress streams as `subagent_pending → tool_call → tool → ai → subagent_complete` events.
4. **Synthesizing** — once all subagents finish, the lead researcher synthesizes a comprehensive final answer.
5. **Complete** — the stream ends with `[DONE]`; the conversation state is checkpointed for future restoration.

### Key Mechanisms

- **Deep Agents + LangGraph**: the `createDeepAgent` function builds a LangGraph graph with subagent orchestration, middleware (retry), checkpointer, and store.
- **Dual stream mode**: uses `stream()` with `streamMode: ['updates', 'messages']` and `subgraphs: true` to capture both lifecycle events and token-level text, mapped to typed SSE events (`ai`, `tool_call`, `tool`, `subagent_pending/step/complete`, `error`).
- **Platform tools**: `web_search` is provided by the EdgeOne Makers runtime via `context.tools.toLangChainTools()`.
- **Checkpointer**: conversation state (messages, tool results) is persisted via `context.store.langgraphCheckpointer`, enabling history restoration.

### Routes

| Route | Method | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `/stream` | POST | Main research (SSE streaming), also handles `action: "history"` and `action: "delete"` |
| `/stop` | POST | Abort an active research run |

The `conversation_id` is passed via the `makers-conversation-id` request header.
